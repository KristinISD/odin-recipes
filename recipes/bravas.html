            </ul>
        <p><h3>HOW TO?</h3></p>
            <ol><h4>Steps to follow</h4>
                <li>Make dipping sauce: Combine garlic, smoked paprika, and salt in a mortar and pestle or food processor;
                    process until smooth. Mix in mayonnaise, sherry vinegar, tomato paste, chipotle chile powder, anc cayenne
                    pepper until combined. Cover and refrigerate sauce.</li>
                <li>Make spice blend: Mix together salt, black pepper, paprika, and chipotle chile powder in a small bowl. Set aside</li>
                <li>Make potatoes: Pour water into a large saucepan. Stir salt, smoked paprika, cumin, and bay leaves into water. Bring to a boil,
                    reduce heat to low, and cover; simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir potatoes into seasoned water, bring to a boil, and simmer until potatoes are tender but not fully cooked, 4 to 5 minutes.
                    The tip of a paring knife should easily insert into the center of a potato cube. Drain potatoes and transfer to
                    a wire rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet or Dutch oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
                <li>Add cooled potato cubes and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.
                    Transfer potatoes to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to cool slightly. Toss a bowl with spice blend and serve with dipping sauce.</li>
            </ol>
